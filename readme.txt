=== 💝 WP Content Pilot has received lots of love from its users: === 

**jeffinmass**
> [I am not a programmer. I am not a WordPress programmer/user, I’m flying by the seat of my pants and learning every step of the way…. painfully but worth it. It’s a great piece of software. Now about WP-Content Pro – it does exactly what it states it does and makes my life with one less very important task to maintain. I need fresh content always for my site visits to see constant new ideas and fresh looks to entice new possibilities. I just received tech support. The chat went very well. My problem was quickly identified and provided a suggestion on how I could cure it. I made the first change and then evidentially with the new update there was a setting I needed to change and then poof! My blog was back up and generating new content. 👏👏](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/practically-maintenance-free-blog-makes-me-look-great/)
